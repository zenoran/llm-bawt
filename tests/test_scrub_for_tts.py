"""Tests for scrub_for_tts — the single source of truth for TTS-safe text.

Voice-optimized bots (e.g. Nova) route their FINALIZED response through
``scrub_for_tts`` before it reaches the TTS engine. Markdown can't be scrubbed
mid-stream, so this runs once on the complete text. These tests lock the
"no markdown survives" contract.
