"""Supervision / self-healing contract for the inter-bot dispatcher (TASK-778).

The 2026-08-07 stuck-delivery incident was caused by an unhandled exception
propagating out of ``run()`` into the leadership task and silently killing it.
These tests pin the two invariants that closed that hole and its follow-ups:

1. ``_leadership_loop`` never dies from a crash inside ``run()`` — it logs and
   restarts the loop under the same leadership.
2. ``run()`` itself absorbs transient sweep failures in-place with exponential
   backoff, so a flapping DB pool does not tear down the task instance on
   every blip (the naked outer guard was observed hot-looping 5× in 25s).
3. ``_schedule_eligible_targets`` no longer silently no-ops when the Redis
   subscriber is offline and ripe deliveries exist — the invisibility was the
   whole reason the original stuck delivery went unnoticed for hours.

These are pure asyncio unit tests against stubbed collaborators; no DB.
