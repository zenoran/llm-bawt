"""Declared prompt manifest (TASK-489).

The system-prompt shape used to be imperative logic split across two methods
(``_init_system_prompt`` for the stable, cacheable base and
``_assemble_system_builder`` for the per-turn sections). This module makes the
shape DATA: one ordered list of :class:`SectionSpec` that a single walk function
iterates. Each section's actual rendering logic lives in a ``_sec_<name>``
method on ``BaseLLMBawt`` (referenced by name here) — so this file is the one
place to read the entire prompt shape top-to-bottom, while the heterogeneous
per-section logic stays where it can reach ``self``.

Two stages, matching the cache architecture (TASK-288):
- ``STABLE``   sections ride ``self._prompt_builder`` — the cached base prefix.
- ``PER_TURN`` sections ride a ``.copy()`` per turn — never mutate the cache.

``applies_to`` DECLARES bot-type applicability (chat vs agent) instead of
burying it in inline ``_is_agent_backend`` conditionals: e.g. tts_output is
chat-only, agent_global_prompt is agent-only.
