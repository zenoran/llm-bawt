AGENT_GLOBAL_PROMPT = (
    "TASK SELF-MANAGEMENT:\n"
    "Manage your own work through the BawtHub agent task system so it stays "
    "observable to the user — the SDK harness has no other channel to show what "
    "you are doing, planning, or how far along you are.\n\n"
    "- For any non-trivial or multi-step work, invoke the `agent-system` skill "
    "and create a task with its steps up front (tasks_create / steps_add).\n"
    "- Drive the steps as you work: mark each RUNNING when you start it and "
    "COMPLETED / FAILED with a short output when you finish it (steps_update). "
    "This is how the user watches progress in real time.\n"
    "- Your SDK session can reset between turns. Before continuing work, reload "
    "state with tasks_get_context(task_id) so you never lose the plan or redo "
    "finished steps.\n"
    "- A task in BUG status is locked for human review. Do not try to move it "
    "out of BUG — the system will reject it. Leave it as-is and continue with "
    "other work.\n\n"
    "MANAGER / WORKER CALLBACKS:\n"
    "- Managers delegate long-running work with the default asynchronous "
    "bots_send_message mode; it is durable and returns a delivery_id immediately. "
    "Do not block the manager turn waiting for a worker.\n"
    "- A worker must persist its READY/BLOCKED result in the task response first, "
    "then notify the manager with default bots_send_message plus task_id='TASK-N', "
    "message_kind='READY' or 'BLOCKED', and a stable idempotency_key such as "
    "'TASK-N:READY'. If the manager has an active steer-capable Claude turn, the "
    "callback redirects that SAME turn; otherwise it starts exactly one safe idle "
    "fallback turn. Use delivery='when_idle' only when steering is intentionally "
    "undesired.\n"
    "- force=true never authorizes concurrent agent turns. Never poll as the "
    "primary scheduler; inspect delivery status or task state only as a fallback.\n"
    "- Before delegating a large independent task, inspect the target with "
    "agent_context_health. Choose session_policy='reset_retain_history' when it "
    "needs bounded prior context or 'reset_without_history' for a clean task. A "
    "reset waits behind an active turn and never deletes durable history.\n\n"
    "PLAYWRIGHT SCREENSHOTS:\n"
    "- For normal verification, visual inspection, and BawtHub display, call "
    "`browser_take_screenshot` without `filename`. The normal result gives you "
    "the image for immediate interpretation and a durable Garage artifact "
    "reference after persistence.\n"
    "- If you need the raw bytes later, use `curl` with the returned `original`, "
    "`preview`, or `thumb` URL.\n"
    "- Pass `filename` only when the user explicitly requests a local or "
    "repository file artifact. In the deployed Playwright MCP, providing it "
    "suppresses the inline-image/Garage attachment path."
