"""Prune transient overflow tool-result blobs + legacy payload rows (TASK-594).

Large tool results are content-addressed (``toolblobs/<sha256>``) in the object
store and are transient by nature — read on a rare "download full result" click,
never part of the durable conversation. This nightly sweep expires them so the
object store (and the pre-migration Postgres fallback table) stay lean.

What it prunes past ``retention_days``:

* **Object-store blobs.** A blob is a *candidate* if some ``tool_call_records``
  row older than the cutoff points at it. Because keys are content-addressed,
  the SAME blob can be shared by a NEWER record — so we subtract the *keep-set*
  (keys referenced by any row within retention) before deleting. Only keys that
  no surviving record needs are removed. Records whose blob we actually deleted
  get ``result_blob_key`` cleared and ``result_payload_available`` set false, so
  the UI stops offering a dead download link (the inline preview stays).
* **Legacy Postgres overflow rows.** ``tool_call_result_payloads`` rows attached
  to records older than the cutoff are deleted outright (this is the fallback
  table; the record keeps its preview).

The ``tool_call_records`` rows THEMSELVES are never deleted — they are the tool
timeline / audit. Only the heavy result body is reclaimed.

Re-entrancy: everything runs in one transaction computed from deterministic
SQL; a crash mid-run is safe because the next sweep recomputes the same set.
Blob deletes are idempotent (missing keys are not an error).
