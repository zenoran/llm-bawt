"""Garbage-collect orphan ``media_assets`` rows + their on-disk blobs (TASK-231).

An asset is an *orphan* if either:

* ``expires_at IS NOT NULL AND expires_at < now()`` — soft-deleted, GC'd
  immediately regardless of age. Producers use ``expires_at`` to mark
  things like failed/abandoned uploads.
* ``created_at < now() - interval 'N days'`` (default 7) **and** no
  ``{bot}_messages.attachments`` row anywhere references the asset by id.

The grace period gives clients a window to retry / paste cleanup / wire
the upload into a follow-up message without us yanking the blob out from
under them. Past the grace, an unreferenced asset is presumed permanently
unused.

Reference scan
--------------
Each per-bot table (``{bot}_messages``) carries an ``attachments`` JSONB
column shaped like ``[{"asset_id": "ma_...", "kind": "image"}, ...]``
(TASK-222). We enumerate every ``*_messages`` table from
``information_schema`` and ``UNION ALL`` their referenced asset ids into
one in-memory set. We do **not** hard-code the bot list — new bots that
land between releases are picked up automatically the next time the job
runs.

The reference set is bounded by the total count of message attachments,
which is small (tens of thousands at most for the foreseeable life of
this project). If that ever stops being true, switch to a per-asset
``EXISTS`` probe instead.

Deletion path
-------------
We delegate to :meth:`llm_bawt.media.store.MediaStore.delete` so blob
files (original / thumb / preview) and the DB row are removed together
with the same shard-prune logic that the upload path established. We
never ``os.unlink`` blobs directly — keeps the deletion path testable
and consistent.

Re-entrancy / crash safety
--------------------------
We compute the orphan list inside a single SELECT, then walk it row by
row calling ``MediaStore.delete``. Each delete is idempotent (deleting
an already-deleted asset returns cleanly). If we crash mid-loop, the
next nightly run picks up where we left off — the orphan list is
deterministic given the same DB state. No locks needed.

Result payload
--------------
``{"orphan_count": int, "deleted_count": int, "freed_bytes": int,
   "dry_run": bool, "errors": list[dict]}``
