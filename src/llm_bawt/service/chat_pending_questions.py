"""Canonical question/answer registry for interactive SDK tool calls.

TASK-269 — deferred/continuation model.  When an agent calls the built-in
``AskUserQuestion`` tool, the bridge does NOT block: ``can_use_tool`` returns
immediately with a synthetic "deferred" ack and the turn ends cleanly.  The
question is persisted here as the durable, recallable record of the ask.  The
user answers anytime (any tab, even days later); the answer endpoint records
it here and the frontend dispatches a *continuation turn* carrying the answer
back to the agent (same-bot: SDK session resume; cross-bot: history rewrite).

Because the turn no longer stays open, a question is NOT abandoned when its
turn ends — it stays ``awaiting`` (== pending) until explicitly answered or
superseded.

State machine:

    awaiting   ─┬─→  answered     (user picked / typed an answer)
                ├─→  superseded   (a newer question replaced this one)
                └─→  abandoned    (explicit drop — session reset, etc.)

Rows are kept indefinitely for audit/recall; callers filter by status.
