    Extracted from the ``/v1/history/context-seed`` handler (TASK-501) so the
    app can assemble the seed IN-PROCESS at dispatch time and push it to the
    bridge via ``inject_messages`` — no HTTP round-trip. The bridge no longer
    has to call back for it.

    Reuses ``HistoryManager.get_context_messages()`` — the exact function the
    chat path uses — so the seed matches what a normal chatbot sees: rolling
    summaries of older sessions PLUS the most recent turns, token-budgeted
    against the model's context window. System rows are dropped (the SDK
    carries its own system prompt).

    Returns ``{bot_id, model, budget_tokens, messages:[{role,content,timestamp}],
