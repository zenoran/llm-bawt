"""Provider usage-adapter interface.

A ``UsageAdapter`` knows how to fetch ONE provider's subscription usage and
map it into the canonical :class:`ProviderUsage`. Each adapter is free to
source its data however it needs — a direct OAuth call (Claude), a static API
key (z.ai), or an RPC to the bridge that owns the credential (codex) — the
registry and the HTTP route don't care.

Adapters must NOT raise for *expected* failure modes (missing credential,
upstream 403/429); they return a ``ProviderUsage`` with the appropriate
``status`` so the UI can render it. Raising is reserved for genuinely
unexpected errors, which the registry catches and turns into a stale/error
snapshot.
