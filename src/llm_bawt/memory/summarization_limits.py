"""Prompt/chunk budgets for history summarization (TASK-858).

One place decides how much conversation a summarization call may carry, so the
route path, the background HISTORY_SUMMARIZATION job and the ``/new`` pre-seed
all size their prompts off the *job model's real context window* instead of a
hardcoded floor.

Before this module existed the budget logic lived only in
``service/routes/history_summaries.py``; the two in-process callers of
``summarize_session_with_client`` passed nothing and silently inherited its
conservative 6000-token default. With a 1M-context job model that rejected
ordinary sessions at ~6.3k tokens ("Summarization prompt too large ...
skipping LLM") and left them permanently heuristic.
