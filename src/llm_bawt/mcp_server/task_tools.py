    BUG status is human-locked: you may SET a task to BUG (to flag a defect for
    the user), but you CANNOT move a task OUT of BUG — the server rejects such
    transitions from agents. Only a human can clear BUG status.

        planned: True after writing spec + steps.

                      hand the task to a different bot.

                task. Use when claiming/starting ordinary-chat work. The server
