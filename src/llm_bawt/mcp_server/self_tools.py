"""MCP tool for agent self-recap.

Registers ``self_recap`` on the shared FastMCP server. When an agent (or the
user, via the agent) asks for a "self recap", this:

  1. Pulls the agent's last N hours of conversation (sent + received).
  2. Ships that transcript to Grok with a structured handoff prompt.
  3. Stores the result as a ``role='summary'`` record (the existing summary
     system) so it survives the session.
  4. Returns the recap text — which, as an MCP tool result, lands in the
     agent's SDK transcript and is replayed into context on the next
     ``resume=`` turn. That is the injection: we lean on the SDK's own
     transcript mechanism rather than fighting it.

Imported by server.py to trigger tool registration on startup.

The prompt has two co-equal priorities: an EXHAUSTIVE itemized TOPIC LOG (every
topic discussed, done or not) and the PENDING / INCOMPLETE work a cold-context
agent must finish. Claimed-vs-verified is enforced throughout.

    content, then reply with a SHORT (1–3 sentence) summary of what you pulled in —
    e.g. how many bubbles, the span/topic, and any obvious open thread — plus a
    forward-moving offer if one is warranted. Only quote a specific bubble
