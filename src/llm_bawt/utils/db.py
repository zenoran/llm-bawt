"""Database utilities shared across the application.

This module centralises SQLAlchemy engine creation so the connection
pool budget is bounded across the whole service.

The rule
--------
**There is one engine per process.** Every Store class
(``BotProfileStore``, ``RuntimeSettingsStore``, ``ProfileManager``,
``TurnLogManager``, ``ModelDefinitionStore``, ``PromptTemplateStore``,
``AnimationStore``, ``MediaGenerationStore``, ``PostgreSQLMemoryBackend``,
…) connects to the same Postgres database with the same credentials.
There is no technical reason for any of them to own a separate
``Engine`` — an engine is just a connection pool, and pools that aren't
shared are pools that compete for the same fixed budget of Postgres
slots.

So: every Store fetches its engine via :func:`get_shared_engine`. The
first call builds the engine; everyone after re-uses it. Stores still
own their own table definitions, queries, and schema — just not their
pool.

Why this matters (TASK-202)
---------------------------
Before this refactor llm-bawt had ~10 Stores in the main process (plus
one PER BOT for memory backends), each constructing its own
``create_engine`` with default ``pool_size=5, max_overflow=10``. With:

    max_postgres_conns_used
        = (pool_size + max_overflow)     # per engine
        × engines_per_process
        × processes_per_container        # app runs 2: llm-service + mcp
        × container_count                # 3 (app + 2 bridges)

…the theoretical ceiling went past 900 against Postgres
``max_connections=100`` (shared with other tenants). Observed
steady-state hit 95/100 and starved every other service.

Sharing one engine collapses the formula to roughly:

    (pool_size + max_overflow) × processes_per_container × container_count

…which keeps the budget under control regardless of how many Store
classes we add.

When NOT to share
-----------------
A separate engine is justified only when the connection settings
genuinely differ — e.g. a different database, a different role, or a
test fixture pointing at SQLite in-memory. Otherwise: share.

    """Create a SQLAlchemy engine with conservative pool settings.

    All llm-bawt code that talks to the shared askllm Postgres database
    SHOULD go through this helper instead of calling ``sqlalchemy.create_engine``
    directly. The helper:

    - Bounds ``pool_size`` / ``max_overflow`` to small values so many engines
      can coexist within Postgres ``max_connections``.
    - Enables ``pool_pre_ping`` so dead connections are replaced instead of
      raising mid-query (and, more importantly for the leak case, so the
      pool will eventually close stale conns rather than hoard them).
    - Sets ``pool_recycle`` so long-idle connections rotate.
    - Tags the connection with ``application_name`` so ``pg_stat_activity``
      reveals which subsystem opened each connection. This is the
      diagnostic hook we wished we'd had during TASK-202.
    - Forces UTC timezone on each new connection.

    Args:
        url: SQLAlchemy URL.
        application_name: Short label that shows up in ``pg_stat_activity``
            (e.g. ``"llm-bawt:profiles"``, ``"llm-bawt:memory:nova"``).
            Strongly recommended.
        pool_size: Steady-state pool size. **Default 2** — do not bump
            without auditing total engine count first.
        max_overflow: Burst slots above ``pool_size``. **Default 3**.
        pool_pre_ping: Validate connections before checkout. Default True.
        pool_recycle: Seconds before a connection is recycled. Default 1800.
        echo: SQLAlchemy SQL echo (debug only).

    Returns:
