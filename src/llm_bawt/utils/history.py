        Fill order, highest priority first:
          1. **Plain system** prompt (persona) — always kept. If it alone exceeds
             the physical budget this raises ``ContextBudgetError`` (the ONLY
             hard-fail). Tool-execution evidence rows (role='system' with a
             ``[Tool Results]`` / ``[Tools used:]`` prefix) are NOT persona — they
             are raw historical context and ride the raw bucket below, so they can
             never trigger this hard-fail.
          2. **Raw** unsummarized history — newest-first, bounded by the Tier-3
             ``history_tokens`` policy knob (default 12000) *and* by physical
             headroom. Includes user/assistant rows plus (inline delivery only)
             interleaved tool-evidence rows. The newest complete turn is floored
             in even when ``history_tokens`` is set absurdly small (degrade-and-log).
          3. **Summaries** — fill the *remaining physical budget* after system +
             raw, newest-first, capped by ``summary_count`` (default 5).
             ``summary_count=0`` carries none (raw-only bot).

        This deliberately reverses the old flow (summaries filled before raw, a
        ``memory_protected_recent_turns`` reservation carved off the top). Under
        the ladder raw already outranks summaries and newest already outranks
        oldest, so the protected-turn reservation is redundant and gone; the
        recent-turn guarantee now falls out of raw-first + newest-first ordering
        plus the newest-complete-turn floor. ``memory_protected_recent_turns`` is
        a Tier-1 summarization-job parameter now (TASK-610), not an assembly knob.

        The raw vs summary partition is the DB ``summarized`` flag (summarized
        sessions become ``role='summary'`` rows; unsummarized stay raw), so the
        two buckets are disjoint by construction — no dedup here.

        Output order is chronological: ``system + summaries + raw``.

        Args:
            max_tokens: physical prompt budget (Tier-2 ``resolve_context_budget``).

            charge_system: whether system rows consume the budget. True for
                        inline (chat) delivery — system is sent in the request
                        window. False for seed delivery (TASK-613): the seed
                        strips system rows (the SDK carries its own byte-stable
                        system prompt), so they must NOT reserve seed tokens and
                        cannot trigger the system-over-budget hard-fail. System
                        rows are still returned/separated either way; only the
                        budgeting differs.
            want_history: whether the caller will actually deliver raw history.
                        When False (summary-only scope), raw is not allocated at
                        all — otherwise it would consume budget here and then be
                        discarded downstream, starving summaries that would have
                        fit (TASK-612 finding 1). Must mirror the caller's
                        ``include_history`` so allocation matches delivery.
            want_summaries: whether the caller will deliver summaries. When False,
