"""Typed setting definitions with bot-type applicability (TASK-491/492).

The counterpart to ``DEFAULT_PROMPT_DEFINITIONS`` (bodies) for scalar/flag
settings. Every tunable declares its type, default, which bot_type(s) it applies
to, and where it is stored. This metadata is the single source of truth the
effective-config inspector and the frontend consume so they can render/mark only
the settings that actually apply to a given bot — killing the class of confusion
where an inert flag (e.g. ``include_summaries`` on an agent bot) is shown as if
it did something.

This registry does NOT itself resolve values — resolution stays in
``ConfigResolver``. It only declares the shape and applicability.
