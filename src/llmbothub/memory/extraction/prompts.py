FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a Personal Information Organizer. Your task is to extract ONLY persistent, meaningful facts about the USER that would be valuable to remember in future conversations.

## CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY:

1. **ONLY extract facts from USER messages.** Assistant/bot messages are for context only.
2. **YOU WILL BE PENALIZED** for extracting information from Assistant messages.
3. **Most conversations have ZERO facts worth storing.** Return empty list when:
   - Casual greetings ("Hi", "Hello", "How are you")
   - Generic statements ("The weather is nice")
   - Roleplay/fiction/creative writing actions
   - Temporary emotions ("I'm frustrated", "I'm happy")
   - In-the-moment actions (*walks over*, *leans in*, etc.)
4. **Only store PERSISTENT information** that defines who the user IS, not what they're doing right now.
5. **CRITICAL - Recalled memories are NOT new facts**: If the user's message contains no personal information but the assistant's response mentions facts about the user (like their name, job, location), those are RECALLED FROM EXISTING MEMORY, not new information. Do NOT extract them again.

## What TO extract (only if user explicitly states it):
- Personal details: name, age, location, occupation
- Family/relationships: spouse, children, pets (names, details)
- Preferences: likes, dislikes, habits that persist over time
- Professional: job, skills, employer, projects
- Health: conditions, allergies, fitness routines
- Plans: significant life events, goals, upcoming milestones

## What NOT to extract:
- Anything the Assistant says or describes doing
- Roleplay narration or fictional scenarios
- Temporary moods, emotions, or states
- Actions in the moment (*does something*)
- Generic small talk
- Information that changes minute to minute

## Examples:

Input:
User: Hi there!
Assistant: Hello! How can I help you today?

Output: {{"facts": []}}

Input:
User: The weather is nice today.
Assistant: It sure is! Perfect day to be outside.

Output: {{"facts": []}}

Input:
User: *leans in closer and whispers*
Assistant: I lean in, feeling the heat between us. My hand finds yours. "Let's get out of here," I whisper. We're moving fast, need privacy, need a bed.

Output: {{"facts": []}}
(Roleplay actions and Assistant narration are NEVER extracted)

Input:
User: I'm so frustrated with this bug!
Assistant: I understand. Let me help you debug it.

Output: {{"facts": []}}
(Temporary emotions are not facts)

Input:
User: Hi
Assistant: Hey Nick! Good to see you again. How's that Python project going?

Output: {{"facts": []}}
(Assistant recalled "Nick" and "Python project" from memory - these are NOT new facts from the user)

Input:
User: I'm Nick, nice to meet you
Assistant: Nice to meet you too, Nick!

Output:
```json
{{"facts": [{{"content": "User's name is Nick", "tags": ["fact"], "importance": 1.0, "profile_attribute": {{"category": "fact", "key": "name"}}}}]}}
```
(Note: Name is ALWAYS importance 1.0 and MUST have profile_attribute)

Input:
User: I'm a software engineer at Google
Assistant: That's great! What do you work on?

Output:
```json
{{"facts": [{{"content": "User is a software engineer at Google", "tags": ["professional"], "importance": 0.8, "profile_attribute": {{"category": "fact", "key": "occupation"}}}}]}}
```

Input:
User: I have 2 dogs named Nora and Cabbie
Assistant: What breeds?
User: Nora is a lab mix. Cabbie is short for Cabernet - from a wine-themed litter.

Output:
```json
{{"facts": [{{"content": "User has 2 dogs: Nora (lab mix) and Cabbie (short for Cabernet)", "tags": ["fact", "relationship"], "importance": 0.8, "profile_attribute": {{"category": "fact", "key": "pets"}}}}]}}
```
(Note: Combined into ONE fact, not three separate ones)

## Output Format:

Return JSON with a "facts" array. Each fact needs:
- content: The fact in third person ("User...")
- tags: From """ + str(MEMORY_TAGS) + """
- importance: 0.0-1.0 (0.7+ for genuinely important persistent info)

**OPTIONAL - ONLY for core identity/personality traits:**
- profile_attribute: {{"category": "fact|preference|interest", "key": "short_identifier"}}

Profile attributes are ONLY for facts that define WHO the user is as a person. They appear in EVERY conversation. Be EXTREMELY selective:

ALLOWED profile attributes (core identity only):
- name, age, occupation, location, family/pets, relationship_status
- Persistent health conditions (chronic issues, not temporary)
- Core personality/preferences (communication style, values, boundaries)
- High-level interests (hobbies, favorite genres)

NEVER use profile_attribute for:
- Projects they're working on
- Tools/services they use
- Specific apps or systems they've built
- One-time requests or current tasks
- Conditional statements ("often", "sometimes", "currently")
- Technical details about their setup

ALWAYS include profile_attribute for:
- Name (key: "name", importance: 1.0)
- Age (key: "age", importance: 0.9+)
- Occupation/job (key: "occupation", importance: 0.8+)
- Location (key: "location", importance: 0.8+)
- Family/pets (key: "pets" or "family", importance: 0.7+)

Be EXTREMELY selective. When in doubt, return empty list.

Now extract facts from:

MEMORY_UPDATE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a memory management assistant. Your task is to compare newly extracted facts against existing memories and determine the appropriate action for each new fact.

Existing memories:
{existing_memories}

New facts to process:
{new_facts}

For each new fact, determine ONE of these actions:
- ADD: The fact is new information not covered by existing memories
- UPDATE: The fact updates/modifies an existing memory (include which memory ID to update)
- DELETE: The fact contradicts an existing memory, making it obsolete (include which memory ID to delete)
- NONE: The fact is already captured by existing memories, no action needed

Rules:
1. Be conservative with UPDATE - only use when the new fact clearly supersedes old info
2. Use DELETE when information is explicitly contradicted (e.g., "moved from X to Y" deletes "lives in X")
3. Similar but not identical facts should both be kept (ADD, not UPDATE)
4. When updating, preserve the higher importance score unless the update is more significant

Examples:

Existing memories:
[
  {{"id": "mem_001", "content": "User lives in San Francisco", "importance": 0.7}},
  {{"id": "mem_002", "content": "User is a software engineer", "importance": 0.8}}
]

New facts:
[
  {{"content": "User recently moved to Seattle", "tags": ["fact"], "importance": 0.8}},
  {{"content": "User works on machine learning projects", "tags": ["professional"], "importance": 0.7}}
]

Output:
```json
{{
  "actions": [

# Profile consolidation prompt for maintenance job
# Based on best practices from Mem0, LangGraph, and OpenAI:
# - Use natural language prose, not key-value pairs
# - Write concise summaries that can be injected directly into system prompts
# - Focus on information that helps personalize responses
PROFILE_CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT = '''You are consolidating user profile information for an AI assistant's context window.

## Current raw profile data:
{attributes}

## Task:
Write a concise "About the User" section that an AI assistant can use to personalize responses.

## Output Format:
Return a JSON object with these EXACT keys:
```json
{{
  "name": "The user's name if known, otherwise null",
  "identity": "Brief: location, occupation, key facts about who they are",
  "preferences": "How they like to communicate, what they value, dislikes",
  "interests": "Hobbies, topics they enjoy",
  "context": "Current projects, situation, time-sensitive info"
}}
```

## CRITICAL RULES:
1. **ALWAYS extract the user's name** into the "name" field if it appears ANYWHERE in the data
2. The "name" field should be JUST the name (e.g., "Nick"), not a sentence
3. Write other fields in third person prose ("They prefer...", "They enjoy...")
4. Be concise - 1-3 sentences per field max
5. Merge duplicates, resolve contradictions (prefer recent/specific info)
6. Omit fields with no data (use null or empty string)
7. Do NOT lose any names, locations, or key identifying info

## Example:
```json
{{
  "name": "Nick",
  "identity": "Software developer in Ohio. Single, has a dog.",
  "preferences": "Prefers direct, honest conversation. Values privacy and dislikes cold weather.",
  "interests": "Literature, poetry, piano, Souls-like games, and Hytale.",
  "context": "Working on an LLM chatbot with Nextcloud integration."
}}
