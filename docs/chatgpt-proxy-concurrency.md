# ChatGPT proxy concurrency and identity contract

The Claude Code bridge proxy intentionally permits parallel upstream streams.
TASK-685's deterministic 1/2/3/5-stream tests show independent progress with
no serialization, starvation, payload crossover, header crossover, or event
loop blocking. The live evidence that motivated the task also showed a healthy
uvicorn loop at three active streams. Therefore there is **no concurrency
semaphore by default**. Latency growth alone is not evidence that serializing
bots would improve throughput.

## Credential and connection ownership

`GET /v1/providers/openai_chatgpt/token` returns `expires_at` as Unix epoch
**seconds** (the JWT `exp` claim). The bridge caches it until five minutes
before expiry and uses an async single-flight lock for cold/near-expiry broker
resolution.

Every registered provider adapter owns one lifecycle-scoped async HTTP pool.
FastAPI starts the pools at proxy startup and closes them once at shutdown.
Responses API requests use request-local OpenAI client views over that shared
pool, so a refreshed bearer token and provider headers cannot mutate another
concurrent request or leak stale state.

## Durable conversation identity and caching

The app already resolves the canonical durable DB `thread_session_id` before
Redis dispatch. The bridge hashes a versioned tuple of:

1. bot ID;
2. bot/user `session_key`;
3. durable `thread_session_id`.

Only the 32-character opaque result crosses into the proxy through Claude
CLI's `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`; raw user/thread identifiers never do. `/new`
rotates the durable thread before dispatch, so it necessarily rotates the
opaque identity. Tool-loop calls and later resume turns retain it.

For the ChatGPT codex backend, this identity is used for both:

- upstream `session_id` header (routing/affinity/concurrency identity);
- `prompt_cache_key` request field (explicit prompt-cache routing key).

Using one durable value makes the isolation boundary explicit and avoids
volatile cache busting. A direct/legacy proxy caller without bridge metadata
falls back to the deterministic opening-prefix hash; real bridge traffic does
not derive identity from prompt content.

## Observability

Each stream emits structured `proxy_stream_start` and `proxy_stream_complete`
logs with request ID, provider, non-secret account hash, bot, conversation hash,
provider/account active counts, queue time, local setup time, upstream TTFB,
total stream duration, input/cached/output tokens, cache-hit percentage, status,
and cumulative provider 429/5xx counts. `queue_ms` is currently zero because no
limiter exists.

If production data later proves account saturation, add a configurable
provider/account semaphore at the observability boundary, report its actual
queue wait, and leave the default unlimited until a measured safe limit is
known. Do not add a bridge-global lock.

## Controlled live smoke

After review, restart only the Claude Code bridge (explicit operator approval
required) so it imports the changed proxy modules. Then run distinct Snark and
Al threads plus one `/new` turn and verify:

- same-thread logs retain `session_hash` across tool loops/resume;
- Snark and Al hashes differ;
- `/new` produces a new hash;
- overlapping streams show `active_provider` above one;
- `setup_ms`, `upstream_ttfb_ms`, and `stream_ms` are independently populated;
- repeated tool-loop calls show high `cache_hit` after the opening call;
- broker-fetch log volume is far below proxy-start volume.

No live smoke should be run from an in-flight bridge-hosted agent turn: the
required bridge restart terminates that turn.
